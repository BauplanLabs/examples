# Playlist recomendations with Bauplan and MongoDB

In this example, we demonstrate how to use [bauplan](https://www.bauplanlabs.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to build a full-stack recommender system.

This application is an embedding-based recommender system from music playlists, using bauplan for data preparation and model training and [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database) for serving.
