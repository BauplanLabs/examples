# Serverless Data Product with Bauplan

This example demonstrates how to build a *pure data product* using Bauplan and AWS Lambda â€” no infrastructure required, fully declarative, and aligned with the `Write-Audit-Publish` pattern.

The product, `yellowTripsDailyStats`, computes and exposes daily average statistics over NYC taxi trips, consuming data from a mock upstream system.
