# LLM to Tabular Pipelines with Bauplan

This is a [Bauplan](https://www.bauplanlabs.com/) reference implementation demonstrating how to transform unstructured data from financial PDFs (SEC 10-Q filings) into structured, analyzable tabular datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs). The pipeline ingests raw PDFs, extracts relevant financial data, and structures it into a final dataset suitable for downstream analysis and visualization.

## Preliminary steps

ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ To use Bauplan, you need an API key for our preview environment. You can request one [here](https://www.bauplanlabs.com/#join).

If you want to get familiar with Bauplan, start with our [tutorial](https://docs.bauplanlabs.com/en/latest/tutorial/01_quick_start.html#).

## Step by Step
