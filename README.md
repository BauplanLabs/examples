# bauplan examples

This is a collection of examples for [bauplan](https://www.bauplanlabs.com/). Use these examples to learn bauplan, explore its capabilities and how to build your own data applications.

## How do I use it?

ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ First, sign up to have an authentication token to set up you API key to access our Beta at [bauplanlabs.com](https://www.bauplanlabs.com/#join).

You can access all bauplan capabilities though CLI commands or through our Python SDK, and build your data applications like simple Python programs.
Remember, although your code runs from your local machine, bauplan operates entirely in the cloud - there is no local version of bauplan.
Your scripts communicate with our cloud platform, which orchestrates and executes data workflows in the cloud.
The best way to get started is to go through our [tutorial](https://docs.bauplanlabs.com/en/latest/tutorial/index.html)

These examples are organized into different folders. Each example is an end-to-end use case you can use bauplan for.
