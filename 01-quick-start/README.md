# Quick Start

Welcome to you bauplan tutorial. Here you will learn the ropes and gain a good understanding of the main capabilities of the platform.

ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ To get started with the tutorial see our [documentation](https://docs.bauplanlabs.com/en/latest/tutorial/01_quick_start.html).

> [!WARNING]
> The platform is in constant development and subject to change without any notice. While all calls are authenticated through a user/key pair, this should not be considered a production-grade secure environment, so please act responsibly. 
> The main data catalog is shared with other users. Act responsibly, do not remove tables from the main catalog unless they are tables you created yourself, because you will be removing them for all other users as well.
